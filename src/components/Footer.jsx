                    This website was a passion project that was made from my love for DDR. This is my first major website development project and thus it is by no means professional in any regard.

                    All of the files used in this project can be found on this sites github repo <a href="https://github.com/Hajurian/ddrsearch">here</a>.

                    With that being said, I'd like to thank my girlfriend, Katie, for helping me design this website (she picked the colors and helped with layouts).
